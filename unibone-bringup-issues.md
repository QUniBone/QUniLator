# UniBone bring-up issues

The appliance image and the Debian package were developed on QBUS hardware.
This log records what the first UniBone board turned up, and how each was
fixed. The board is `unibone.huebner.org`, a BeagleBone Black carrying a
UniBone cape in a PDP-11 Unibus machine.

## 1. The service passed a QBUS address width

    unibone[730]: QUniLator web service starting, UNIBUS emulation.
    unibone[730]: FATAL QUNIBUS: Address width of 18 bits invalid!
    unibone.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE

`packaging/debian/qbone.service` is the template for both packages, and its
`ExecStart` carried `--addresswidth 22`. The Unibus is 18 bit, so the UNIBUS
build's `set_addr_width()` — whose 16 and 22 cases are compiled only for QBUS —
rejected it and the emulator exited before opening its web port.

The width is a property of the bus the binary was built for, so the binary
supplies it: 22 bit on QBUS, 18 on UNIBUS, with `--addresswidth` remaining for
a QBUS board fronting a 16 or 18 bit CPU. The unit passes no width at all.

Fixed in `main_qbone_web.cpp` (per-bus default and validation) and
`packaging/debian/qbone.service`.

## 2. The rejected width was reported as the current one

The FATAL above named 18 bits, which is the *valid* width — the argument was
22. `set_addr_width()` printed its member `addr_width`, already set to 18 by
the UNIBUS constructor, instead of the `_addr_width` it was refusing.

Fixed in `10.01_base/2_src/arm/qunibus.cpp`.

## 3. The UniBone package described itself as a Qbus emulator

`build-deb.sh` rebrands `qbone`/`QBone` to `unibone`/`UniBone` when it packages
the UNIBUS build, but the bus name was not among the tokens it rewrote, so the
unit's `Description=` and the package description both read "PDP-11 Qbus device
emulator" on a Unibus board.

`rebrand` now maps `Qbus` to the board's bus as well.

Fixed in `packaging/build-deb.sh`.
